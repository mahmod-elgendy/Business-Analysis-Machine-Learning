# Business Analysis Model (Beta)

This is the **Beta** version of the Business Analysis Model. It is a work in progress and still requires many improvements to enhance accuracy and efficiency.

## Overview
The **Business Analysis Model** is a data-driven tool designed to analyze business performance by processing financial and sales data. It calculates key financial metrics such as total revenue, profit margin, operational costs, and employee costs. Additionally, it includes machine learning models to predict restocking needs and future sales based on historical data.

## Features
- **Financial Analysis**: Computes total revenue, profit, profit margin, and costs.
- **Employee Cost Analysis**: Calculates total employee-related expenses.
- **Operational Cost Calculation**: Estimates costs related to business operations.
- **Predictive Analysis (Beta)**: Uses machine learning models to predict restocking needs and future sales trends. Currently, this feature is in the testing phase and requires improvements for better accuracy.

## Files
- `training.csv`: Dataset containing historical sales and stock data.
- `business.csv`: Dataset containing business-related financial data.
- `Business_Analysis_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the business analysis and machine learning models.

## How to Use
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If a requirements.txt file is provided
   ```
2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Business_Analysis_Model.ipynb
   ```
3. **Modify and Improve:** This is a **Beta version**, and many aspects require further optimization, including:
   - Refining machine learning models to improve accuracy.
   - Enhancing cost calculation logic.
   - Improving error handling and efficiency.
   - Adding documentation and comments for better understanding.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize ML model convergence for better predictions.
- Improve data pre-processing and handling of missing values.
- Enhance cost calculation methods to ensure accuracy.
- Improve code structure and efficiency.

## Contributing
Since this is a beta version, any contributions to improve functionality, accuracy, and performance are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request.

## Files
- `training.csv` â€“ Contains sales and stock data for analysis.
- `business.csv` â€“ Includes business operational and employee cost data.
- `Business_Analysis_Model.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook implementing the business analysis and machine learning predictions.

## Disclaimer
This is a **work in progress (Beta version)**. The business analysis and machine learning predictions need significant improvements. The current implementation may contain inaccuracies and should not be used for critical decision-making without further validation.

Feel free to contribute and improve the model! ðŸš€
